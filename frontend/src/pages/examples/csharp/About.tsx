//This page should have the following:
//   I grew up in Minnesota. Visited England, Ireland, and Whales when I was 16 through People to People (started by Dwight D. Eisenhower), Graduated HS, Moved to Germany when I was 19 to teach/tutor English at a boarding school.  Studied Linguistics (regrettably not a degree with a B.S. in front of it), Helped adults meet their educational goals for 10 years, while pursuing the idea of starting a recording studio, moved to Hawaii for 1 year (avoided serious sun burn), moved to Oregon to fix MFDs, PANDEMIC!, Web Developer...

//Philosophy
//I believe in the value of TDD when the tests are written properly, however I have yet to fully learn how to use e2e suites like Cypress.  OO and Functional Programming can co-exist in my world (there's a time and place for both).
//prefer to be Agile when possible rather than a Waterfall
//Find it important to create things I would want to use as well as the intended audience
//prefer leave the design to others
//love to get my hands dirty by building systems and fixing bugs (especially love the feeling of fixing something I initially thought was unfixable/impossible)

//interests: playing drums/guitar, riding bike, exercising, Astronomy(almost majored in it)
