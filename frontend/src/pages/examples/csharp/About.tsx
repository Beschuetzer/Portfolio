//This page should have the following:
//   I grew up in Minnesota. Visited England, Ireland, and Whales when I was 16 through People to People (started by Dwight D. Eisenhower), Graduated HS, Moved to Germany when I was 19 to teach/tutor English at a boarding school.  Studied Linguistics (regrettably not a degree with a B.S. in front of it), Helped adults meet their educational goals for 10 years, while pursuing the idea of starting a recording studio, moved to Hawaii for 1 year (avoided serious sun burn), moved to Oregon to fix MFDs, PANDEMIC!, Web Developer...

//Philosophy
//I believe in the value of TDD when the tests are written properly, however I have yet to fully learn how to use e2e suites like Cypress.  OO and Functional Programming can co-exist in my world (there's a time and place for both).
//prefer to be Agile when possible rather than a Waterfall
//Find it important to create things I would want to use as well as the intended audience
//prefer leave the design to others
//love to get my hands dirty by building systems and fixing bugs (especially love the feeling of fixing something I initially thought was unfixable/impossible)

//interests: playing drums/guitar, riding bike, exercising, Astronomy(almost majored in it)

				<CSharpCardSection title="Making the Most of a Tough Situation">
					The outbreak of the COVID-19 Pandemic provided me with a lot of time
					to reflect on my career choices and where I want to be in 10 years
					time.&nbsp; By means of said careful reflection, I realized that I
					would not be able to live a self-realized life, if I did not give it
					my best shot at professional coder.

					I have always been enamored with the idea of becoming a computer
					programmer.&nbsp; If my dad had not had a heart attack, I am sure I
					would have chosen to study Computer Science at University instead of
					Linguistics.&nbsp; The constant The thing is, my dad was a programmer
					for a company called Deluxe for 1 years.&nbsp; However, I saw how much
					my dadâ€™s new position as a project manager caused him a lot of stress,
					which eventually to a heart attack.&nbsp; I naively attributed his
					heart attack to coding in my mind and decided to pursue other things,
					even though I had a thing for programming.&nbsp;, and I finally
					realized that this may be my last chance to become a programmer.&nbsp;

					Music has been a big part of my life since I was young.&nbsp; Ever
					since first discovered Fruity Loops, I have been using music as a
					cathartic outlet.&nbsp; The songs are almost universally of low
