//This page should have the following:
//   I grew up in Minnesota. Visited England, Ireland, and Whales when I was 16 through People to People (started by Dwight D. Eisenhower), Graduated HS, Moved to Germany when I was 19 to teach/tutor English at a boarding school.  Studied Linguistics (regrettably not a degree with a B.S. in front of it), Helped adults meet their educational goals for 10 years, while pursuing the idea of starting a recording studio, moved to Hawaii for 1 year (avoided serious sun burn), moved to Oregon to fix MFDs, PANDEMIC!, Web Developer...

//Philosophy
//I believe in the value of TDD when the tests are written properly, however I have yet to fully learn how to use e2e suites like Cypress.  OO and Functional Programming can co-exist in my world (there's a time and place for both).
//prefer to be Agile when possible rather than a Waterfall
//Find it important to create things I would want to use as well as the intended audience
//prefer leave the design to others
//love to get my hands dirty by building systems and fixing bugs (especially love the feeling of fixing something I initially thought was unfixable/impossible)

//interests: playing drums/guitar, riding bike, exercising, Astronomy(almost majored in it)

				<CSharpCardSection title="Making the Most of a Tough Situation">
					The outbreak of the COVID-19 Pandemic provided me with a lot of time
					to reflect on my career choices and where I want to be in 10 years
					time.&nbsp; By means of said careful reflection, I realized that I
					would not be able to live a self-realized life, if I did not give it
					my best shot at professional coder.

					I have always been enamored with the idea of becoming a computer
					programmer.&nbsp; If my dad had not had a heart attack, I am sure I
					would have chosen to study Computer Science at University instead of
					Linguistics.&nbsp; The constant The thing is, my dad was a programmer
					for a company called Deluxe for 1 years.&nbsp; However, I saw how much
					my dadâ€™s new position as a project manager caused him a lot of stress,
					which eventually to a heart attack.&nbsp; I naively attributed his
					heart attack to coding in my mind and decided to pursue other things,
					even though I had a thing for programming.&nbsp;, and I finally
					realized that this may be my last chance to become a programmer.&nbsp;

					since first discovered Fruity Loops, I have been using music as a
					cathartic outlet.&nbsp; The songs are almost universally of low
					quality, but the act of getting the idea out of my head into the real
					world is really the part that brings me joy.&nbsp; Listening to the
					song reminds me of the process.&nbsp;
