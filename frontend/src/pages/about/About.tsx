				<h3>Making the Most of a Tough Situation</h3>
				<p>
					The outbreak of the COVID-19 Pandemic provided me with a lot of time to reflect on my career choices and where I want to be in 10 years time.  
				</p>
				<p>
					By means of said careful reflection, I realized that I would not be able to live a self-realized life, if I did not give it my best shot at professional coder. 
				</p>
				<h3>A Long Time Coming</h3>
				<p>
					I have always been enamored with the idea of becoming a computer programmer.  If my dad had not had a heart attack, I am sure I would have chosen to study Computer Science at University instead of Linguistics.  
				</p>
				<p>

					The thing is, my dad was a programmer for a company called Deluxe for 1 years.    However, I saw how much my dadâ€™s new position as a project manager caused him a lot of stress, which eventually to a heart attack.  I naively attributed his heart attack to coding in my mind and decided to pursue other things, even though I had a thing for programming.), and I finally realized that this may be my last chance to become a programmer.
