  //This page should have the following:
  //   I grew up in Minnesota. Visited England, Ireland, and Whales when I was 16 through People to People (started by Dwight D. Eisenhower), Graduated HS, Moved to Germany when I was 19 to teach/tutor English at a boarding school.  Studied Linguistics (regrettably not a degree with a B.S. in front of it), Helped adults meet their educational goals for 10 years, while pursuing the idea of starting a recording studio, moved to Hawaii for 1 year (avoided serious sun burn), moved to Oregon to fix MFDs, PANDEMIC!, Web Developer...
  
	//Philosophy
		//I believe in the value of TDD when the tests are written properly, however I have yet to fully learn how to use e2e suites like Cypress.  OO and Functional Programming can co-exist in my world (there's a time and place for both). 
		//prefer to be Agile when possible rather than a Waterfall
		//Find it important to create things I would want to use as well as the intended audience
		//prefer leave the design to others
		//love to get my hands dirty by building systems and fixing bugs (especially love the feeling of fixing something I initially thought was unfixable/impossible)
		
	//interests: playing drums/guitar, riding bike, exercising, Astronomy(almost majored in it)

				<h3>Making the Most of a Tough Situation</h3>
				<p>
					The outbreak of the COVID-19 Pandemic provided me with a lot of time to reflect on my career choices and where I want to be in 10 years time.  
				</p>
				<p>
					By means of said careful reflection, I realized that I would not be able to live a self-realized life, if I did not give it my best shot at professional coder. 
				</p>
				<h3>A Long Time Coming</h3>
				<p>
					I have always been enamored with the idea of becoming a computer programmer.  If my dad had not had a heart attack, I am sure I would have chosen to study Computer Science at University instead of Linguistics.  
				</p>
				<p>
					The constant 
					The thing is, my dad was a programmer for a company called Deluxe for 1 years.    However, I saw how much my dadâ€™s new position as a project manager caused him a lot of stress, which eventually to a heart attack.  I naively attributed his heart attack to coding in my mind and decided to pursue other things, even though I had a thing for programming.), and I finally realized that this may be my last chance to become a programmer.
