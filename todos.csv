Temporary things to do---------------------------------
  add select A# Maj Bridge source code to a public repository for resume

IDEAS-----------------------------------------------------------
  -add hover popup for references that pops up a card with image, quote (recommendation from ziprecruiter, and letter of recommendation from scott?), more detailed info about relationship with reference;  add personal references?

  -on root route:
    -have words orbiting a planet with a work on it?
    artistically place multiple words that mean something and then have a description of their importance in the coding when show up as a unique pop up/slide in effect: 
      -what is an Adam Major (click a word to find out more)?
      -curiosity
      -driven
      -excellence
      -listening
      -







-videos to do:
  navigating the menu
  handling errors (just refresh)


-figure out how to create a bash script to get all of the .js files in a dir and its sub-dirs and then create .ts files in the same location with the contents of the respective .js file


-finish csharp and autobid.txt

-finish BridgeHero
-bridge vision:
  2. have each section be a separate 'card'
    3.11 SectionContainer has a background image of a suit
    3.12 Transitioning between section containers happens by clicking one of two buttons (arrows at the left and right of section).
    3.13 SectionContainers flow color-wise from left-right and right-left
    3.2 content is a linear gradient to right and an svg of a card suit


  -make sure that SkillsPopup links to examples on site are Links not anchor tags

-add click to seek on progress bar?
-firefox is quite sluggish (seems to have to do with SiteNav)
-mobile bridge------------
  -first section doesn't expand content all the way (height auto not working)
  -videos off

-firefox issues:
  1) BridgeHero animation
  
-Go through every component and check for cases where I could use useCallback or useMemo?"
-SiteNav examples for non-touch devices should be expanded
-change "Features" main title to the title of clicked video on play and reset on close
-how can one dynamically change transform-origin based on where an item is in the grid (for Cards at smaller viewports)?
  -one possible idea is to iterate through each card whenever the viewport changes and assign transform origins based on the x and y coordinates of the cards keeping track of the x coordinate and then finding all the instance where x coordinates are the same for the first and last item in the first row
