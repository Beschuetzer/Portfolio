IDEAS-----------------------------------------------------------
  -add hover popup for references that pops up a card with image, quote (recommendation from ziprecruiter, and letter of recommendation from scott?), more detailed info about relationship with reference;  add personal references?

      -driven
      -excellence
      -listening
      -

-figure out bridge color pallette
-need to fix changing from bridge to resume


-videos to do:
  navigating the menu
  claim some feature in detail
  handling errors (just refresh)

  2. have each section be a separate 'card'
  3. a card is a title (10vh?) and content(90vh)

    3.12 Transitioning between section containers happens by clicking one of two buttons (arrows at the left and right of section).
    3.13 SectionContainers flow color-wise from left-right and right-left
    3.2 content is a linear gradient to right and an svg of a card suit
