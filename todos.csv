-fix navbar animation glitch when clicking to close right after opening
-add hover effect for nav button when it is A
-work on changing nav button direction to open down below ~685px

-need to figure out how to clear timeout to remove isAnimating for class based components (you can use useEffect for function-based)

-remove all pieces of state and add to redux store instead
-convert Nav to function components
