BUGS------------------------------------
  -bug with PageNav and no mouse where the scroll scaling doesn't apply to the last clicked item as it has :hover (is there a way to trigger a touch/click event in JS? so as to clear the :hover state) (remove hover effect on card when mobile input after close?)
  -PlayControl and RestartControl handleVideoProgress listeners can be run at the same time (doesn't seem to affect performance though)
  -when visiting all three video pages then waiting ~15 mins  with dev servers running, causes chrome to crash (but a single firefox tab?)
    -running no dev server, single tab mozilla, 20mins = no crash

IDEAS-----------------------------------------------------------
  -add hover popup for references that pops up a card with image, quote (recommendation from ziprecruiter, and letter of recommendation from scott?), more detailed info about relationship with reference;  add personal references?


OPTIMIZATIONS:
  -memoize Card functions?
  -Go through every component and check for cases where I could use useCallback or useMemo?"




-figure out how to create a bash script to get all of the .js files in a dir and its sub-dirs and then create .ts files in the same location with the contents of the respective .js file

-need to do responsive images everywhere
-finish csharp and autobid.txt

-add a popdown menu when hovering over a Pagenav item that has multiple subsections, showing each subsection as a clickable link?
-work on the little matter of how onwards (doesn't flow well)

-mobile doesn't work with SiteNav showing examples expanded

-consider a different bridge animation like fade in

-maybe alternate the rotation speed of cube based on user mouse interactions?


-how hard would it be to add a better animation to examples opening up in SiteNav?

-double check that no event listeners don't get cleaned up on page change


-need responsive styling for video carouselitems 
-work on OverlayText styling for CarouselItem
-add svgs to csharp layouts
-add notes to playlist syncer page?  what else to say about it?
-add form to contact page that sends text and email when clicked?
-finish content in about
-finish last 4th section in bridge (and colors gradient for mobile and svg

-call getFromStartToFinishUsingFunction() to get number to multiply by when doing the pan down for orbit controls then use that in render

-remove all html overlays (add in on timer through opacity)
-add timeout to start animation as well
