JOB STUFF------------------------------------
  -add an X in top right of carousel video overlay to be able to pause video and see what is there.
  -make the carousel handle the calculation in setCarouselGridMaxColumnWidth() for $carousel-grid-width (instead of having to hard code in css variables)
  -adjust height of code links on right (should match page nav start on left)
  -how hard to make the site nav and github buttons smaller?
  -create a Solution Sidekick feature page (add to start page too; left side)
  -add challenges (make a 3js demo for horse jump code)
  -update downloadable resume
  -Remove logs from portfolio utils.ts 203
  -figure out why letting start animation complete, navigate to page, then back doesn't properly reset the animation
  -look into free options for other sites (dynamo are no longer free and don't work atm)
  -add resume end date 11/12 for contract work and 11/13 for FTE work
  -add resume line talking point "10X increase in user base since starting" for Best Buy contract
  -minify SSK videos
  -add pdf updated resume
  -make york repos public (team and personal) and add a description to both with links (add tags too and make sure they are referenced in the resume section)
  -increase values for React, Bootstrap, Redux, and PostGreSQL
  -add links to best buy and york projects in the resume section (embedded links)
  -mobile - scrolling on own phone glitchy up and down fast
  -adjust PageNav such that the scroll percent is 100 for previous item when it is in the middle of the screen
  -add sort options of skill examples?

BUGS------------------------------------
  -mobile start screen doesn't show all of bottom and not scrollable
  -after playing a song then stopping and closing the player, the orange tab still appears
  -bridge video cards don't close when another one is opened
  -fix carousel issue (use 3rd party lib?)
  -bug with PageNav and no mouse where the scroll scaling doesn't apply to the last clicked item as it has :hover (is there a way to trigger a touch/click event in JS? so as to clear the :hover state) (remove hover effect on card when mobile input after close?)
  -PlayControl and RestartControl handleVideoProgress listeners can be run at the same time (doesn't seem to affect performance though)
  -when visiting all three video pages then waiting ~15 mins  with dev servers running, causes chrome to crash (but a single firefox tab?)
    -running no dev server, single tab mozilla, 20mins = no crash
  -changing viewport on home shows scroll text after it has faded out
  -changing viewport on home doesn't change text height spacing durin scroll
  -can't have multiple carousels on page due to same css var name


IDEAS-----------------------------------------------------------
  -add hover popup for references that pops up a card with image, quote (recommendation from ziprecruiter, and letter of recommendation from scott?), more detailed info about relationship with reference;  add personal references?


OPTIMIZATIONS:
  -memoize Card functions?
  -Go through every component and check for cases where I could use useCallback or useMemo?"




-figure out how to create a bash script to get all of the .js files in a dir and its sub-dirs and then create .ts files in the same location with the contents of the respective .js file

-need to do responsive images everywhere
-finish csharp and autobid.txt

-add a popdown menu when hovering over a Pagenav item that has multiple subsections, showing each subsection as a clickable link?
-work on the little matter of how onwards (doesn't flow well)

-consider a different bridge animation like fade in

-maybe alternate the rotation speed of cube based on user mouse interactions?


-how hard would it be to add a better animation to examples opening up in SiteNav?

-double check that no event listeners don't get cleaned up on page change


-need responsive styling for video carouselitems 
-work on OverlayText styling for CarouselItem
-add svgs to csharp layouts
-add notes to playlist syncer page?  what else to say about it?
-finish content in about

-change how the left,right,and bottom divs come in (stagger them timewise for a more interesting fx)




NOT SURE------------------------------------------------------------
  'I'm excited that you're here.'
  'This is the perfect opportunity'
  'to highlight some of my work'

  'I enjoy a difficult challange'
  'as well as 
  'but most of all meeting new people'

  'Feel free to parouse the site'
  'and make an evaluation for yourself'


-ideas for suggestions on home page 
  "get to know me on a personal level" <-- link to about page
  "Dive into the making of a trick-based card game"

  -create an html link that has a span as innerhtml that removes the ancor tag's styling , effectivelyrending it regular text surrounding by text that uses the same link.

mobile issues---------------------
  -examples link not expanded in navbar

-change scroll sensitivity (have it scroll futher down each scroll)
-finish about content
-finish about section story

Purpose of about--------------------------------------------
Bringing across the information that will make potential clients and employers stick around to find out more about you, in the hope of working with you, is crucial.

That being said, it's considered good practice to include an "About" section on your site. In this section, give a well-revised version of the most important (relevant) information about yourself, your experience, and maybe your approach as well.

Of course, there can be variation, but the most important thing is to try to identify your unique selling points and validators (past work and/or skills) and point them out as clearly as possible.
