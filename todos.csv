Temporary things to do---------------------------------
  add select A# Maj Bridge source code to a public repository for resume

IDEAS-----------------------------------------------------------
  -add hover popup for references that pops up a card with image, quote (recommendation from ziprecruiter, and letter of recommendation from scott?), more detailed info about relationship with reference;  add personal references?

  -on root route:
    -have words orbiting a planet with a work on it?
    artistically place multiple words that mean something and then have a description of their importance in the coding when show up as a unique pop up/slide in effect: 
      -what is an Adam Major (click a word to find out more)?
      -curiosity
      -driven
      -excellence
      -listening
      -


OPTIMIZATIONS:
  -memoize Card functions?
  -Go through every component and check for cases where I could use useCallback or useMemo?"




-figure out how to create a bash script to get all of the .js files in a dir and its sub-dirs and then create .ts files in the same location with the contents of the respective .js file

-finish csharp and autobid.txt

-Add images to SiteNav examples links
-Need to figure out how to handle Bridge Card Videos not displaying due to lack of hover (how to check if device is touch screen in React?)
-remove hover effect on card when mobile input after close?
-move card player button positions for all vports
-use scrollToSection for PageNav bridge mobile render case
