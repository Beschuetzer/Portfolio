BUGS------------------------------------
  -bug with PageNav and no mouse where the scroll scaling doesn't apply to the last clicked item as it has :hover (is there a way to trigger a touch/click event in JS? so as to clear the :hover state) (remove hover effect on card when mobile input after close?)
  -PlayControl and RestartControl handleVideoProgress listeners can be run at the same time (doesn't seem to affect performance though)


Temporary things to do---------------------------------
  add select A# Maj Bridge source code to a public repository for resume

IDEAS-----------------------------------------------------------
  -add hover popup for references that pops up a card with image, quote (recommendation from ziprecruiter, and letter of recommendation from scott?), more detailed info about relationship with reference;  add personal references?

  -on root route:
    -have words orbiting a planet with a work on it?
    artistically place multiple words that mean something and then have a description of their importance in the coding when show up as a unique pop up/slide in effect: 
      -what is an Adam Major (click a word to find out more)?
      -curiosity
      -driven
      -excellence
      -listening
      -


OPTIMIZATIONS:
  -memoize Card functions?
  -Go through every component and check for cases where I could use useCallback or useMemo?"




-figure out how to create a bash script to get all of the .js files in a dir and its sub-dirs and then create .ts files in the same location with the contents of the respective .js file

-need to do responsive images everywhere
-finish csharp and autobid.txt

-add a popdown menu when hovering over a Pagenav item that has multiple subsections, showing each subsection as a clickable link?
-work on the little matter of how onwards (doesn't flow well)

-mobile doesn't work with SiteNav showing examples expanded

-consider a different bridge animation like fade in

-add mouse listener that moves sun up and down when moving mouse up and down
-maybe alternate the rotation speed of cube based on user mouse interactions?
-add background to 4th section in bridge (and colors gradient for mobile
-change name section to grid

downloader and playlist-sync:
  -add videos to carousel


playlist-sync:
  -find a color pallette for playlist-syncer

-adjust text-max-width for videos
-add hover fx and fill change fx
-have close control take up all of fg-video screen (can remove the normal close click handler for video if it works)
-put controls into spots

- add classes to carousel__item for --open, --playing, etc and style (ADD USEREF IN CAROUSELITEM AND SEND REF TO CONTROLS).
-close control doesn't work in cards on bridge page
-full-screen not being removed from carousel__video onopen and close
