Temporary things to do---------------------------------
  add select A# Maj Bridge source code to a public repository for resume

IDEAS-----------------------------------------------------------
  -add hover popup for references that pops up a card with image, quote (recommendation from ziprecruiter, and letter of recommendation from scott?), more detailed info about relationship with reference;  add personal references?

  -on root route:
    -have words orbiting a planet with a work on it?
    artistically place multiple words that mean something and then have a description of their importance in the coding when show up as a unique pop up/slide in effect: 
      -what is an Adam Major (click a word to find out more)?
      -curiosity
      -driven
      -excellence
      -listening
      -







-videos to do:
  navigating the menu
  handling errors (just refresh)


-figure out how to create a bash script to get all of the .js files in a dir and its sub-dirs and then create .ts files in the same location with the contents of the respective .js file


-finish csharp and autobid.txt

-finish BridgeHero
-bridge vision:
  2. have each section be a separate 'card'
    3.11 SectionContainer has a background image of a suit
    3.12 Transitioning between section containers happens by clicking one of two buttons (arrows at the left and right of section).
    3.13 SectionContainers flow color-wise from left-right and right-left
    3.2 content is a linear gradient to right and an svg of a card suit


  -make sure that SkillsPopup links to examples on site are Links not anchor tags


-have bridge-hero disappear after scrolling down to the bottom
-add currentSelection select to signify currently selected Bridge Section (left: 0)
-use left property to transform each card depending on which arrow is pressed and which section has the currentSelection class

-have each card's transform-origin depend on nth item (e.g. 1st from top left and last from bottom right)
-re-record videos in bridge.txt
-need to get king cards made in svg format
-figure out how to get play, pause, and stop svgs to display at the correct moments during playback by assigning 
-when clicking to play remove card--hoverable and maxizize the window to the section__content (or maybe have a side bar with text?)
-make card__content a grid with video on left 3/4 and right 1/4 being a description of the video that becomes visible when the play button is clicked
