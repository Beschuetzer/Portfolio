Temporary things to do---------------------------------
  add select A# Maj Bridge source code to a public repository for resume

IDEAS-----------------------------------------------------------
  -add hover popup for references that pops up a card with image, quote (recommendation from ziprecruiter, and letter of recommendation from scott?), more detailed info about relationship with reference;  add personal references?

  -on root route:
    -have words orbiting a planet with a work on it?
    artistically place multiple words that mean something and then have a description of their importance in the coding when show up as a unique pop up/slide in effect: 
      -what is an Adam Major (click a word to find out more)?
      -curiosity
      -driven
      -excellence
      -listening
      -







-videos to do:
  navigating the menu
  handling errors (just refresh)


-figure out how to create a bash script to get all of the .js files in a dir and its sub-dirs and then create .ts files in the same location with the contents of the respective .js file


-finish csharp and autobid.txt

-finish BridgeHero
-bridge vision:
  2. have each section be a separate 'card'
    3.11 SectionContainer has a background image of a suit
    3.12 Transitioning between section containers happens by clicking one of two buttons (arrows at the left and right of section).
    3.13 SectionContainers flow color-wise from left-right and right-left
    3.2 content is a linear gradient to right and an svg of a card suit


  -make sure that SkillsPopup links to examples on site are Links not anchor tags

-add click to seek on progress bar?
-firefox is quite sluggish (seems to have to do with SiteNav)
-mobile bridge------------
  -first section doesn't expand content all the way (height auto not working)
  -videos off


-Go through every component and check for cases where I could use useCallback or useMemo?"
-bridge mobile linear gradients and spacing between sections

-can remove checkbox stuff in Card?
-memoize Card functions?
-add Responsive Web Design tags to git hub projects and add as skill (bridge, resume, and Advanced CSS course projects)?
-finish BridgeHero header animation
-SiteNav examples for non-touch devices should be expanded
-Add images to SiteNav examples links
-Change styling for pageNav
-clicking hero___more then scrolling down doesn't show right arrow
-clicking arrow right then going to resume then going back to bridge causes the right arrows not to apply 'current-section' to any of the sections (actually it gets applied but it gets removed somehone after handleSliding();)
