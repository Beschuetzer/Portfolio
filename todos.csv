BUGS------------------------------------
  -bug with PageNav and no mouse where the scroll scaling doesn't apply to the last clicked item as it has :hover (is there a way to trigger a touch/click event in JS? so as to clear the :hover state) (remove hover effect on card when mobile input after close?)
  -PlayControl and RestartControl handleVideoProgress listeners can be run at the same time (doesn't seem to affect performance though)
  -when downloader or playlist-sync is loaded and computer locks, chrome crashes?

IDEAS-----------------------------------------------------------
  -add hover popup for references that pops up a card with image, quote (recommendation from ziprecruiter, and letter of recommendation from scott?), more detailed info about relationship with reference;  add personal references?


OPTIMIZATIONS:
  -memoize Card functions?
  -Go through every component and check for cases where I could use useCallback or useMemo?"




-figure out how to create a bash script to get all of the .js files in a dir and its sub-dirs and then create .ts files in the same location with the contents of the respective .js file

-need to do responsive images everywhere
-finish csharp and autobid.txt

-add a popdown menu when hovering over a Pagenav item that has multiple subsections, showing each subsection as a clickable link?
-work on the little matter of how onwards (doesn't flow well)

-mobile doesn't work with SiteNav showing examples expanded

-consider a different bridge animation like fade in

-add mouse listener that moves sun up and down when moving mouse up and down
-maybe alternate the rotation speed of cube based on user mouse interactions?
-add background to 4th section in bridge (and colors gradient for mobile
-change name section to grid

-add hover fx and fill change fx
-fix bug where changing pages via SiteNav causes PageNav color to be incorrect until scrolling 
-bridge page is very choppy (can separate out, add hooks and refactor to optimize?)
-how hard would it be to add a better animation to examples opening up in SiteNav?

-add svgs to csharp layouts
-create a sass function that can insert colors into the svgs and return data
-remove mapStateToProps and ampDispatchToProps (the function {} after); use newest version of react-redux 
-add functionality where when you click a web dev subsection it calls scrollTo() in helpers to make that section at the top
-double check that no event listeners don't get cleaned up on page change
-add optional message box that pops up over <Video/> when video--stopped is applied (Similar to bridge cards)?
