Carousel rework
  -work on progressbar rework:
    --item modal is not positioned correctly in fullscreen mode
    --toolbar is not positioned correctly in fullscreen mode
    --move all instances of getCurrentValue calls from StylingLogic to OptionsLogic
    --need to remove cursor: none on body when a re-size occurs
    --bottom case for CarouselModal in correct spot
    --todo need to add listners for progress bar and screenshot viewer when mobile (touchstart and touchend?)
    --figure out why CarouselVideoCurrentTimeViewer doesn't seems to work at some spots in some videos (e.g. 1st video middle area)
    --add component in CarouselVideo to show the snapshot when changing percent via bar
    --add options for thubnail snapshot 
    --figure out why swipe handler gets trigger sometimes
    --verify all of the progress bar customization options still work when done 

  -go through the video items and add appropriate overlay text and sections (when approrpriate for that item)
  -check how fullscreen looks on phone (should rotate)
  -add a single option for full width single item per page with only circular buttons
  -make CarouselElementCustomization.style a CarouselElementValue?
  -need to work on individual options for each button size
  -make sure buttonSize works with custom icons
  -when done with buttonSize stuff, clean up css styles
  -add volume button for videos?
  -how to intelligently add themes or default colors?
  -add a colors.scss and pick an actual color design and refactor all colors to use it (use custom properties too to make customizable?); name `color1`, `color2`, etc?
  -figure out how to memoize options and styling logic (e.g. when playing a video, the styling getters run each time)
  -add lazy loading of items (only render the items up to the furtherst currentPage)?
  -update all custom test case
  -figure out how to test and implement accessability
  -write jest tests for utils and other functions?

Known Issues with Carousel rework:
  -progress bar for non-embedded case a bit sloppy (try changing widths to flat px amount (width of middle section, non embedded case grows on hover))
  -small gap at bottom of toolbar (only appears a smaller viewports around 845px)
  -changing items with mid-tier and below setting is sluggish
  -CarouselElementValue only updates when CarouselContent re-renders; if dynamic spacing is on, then re-renders occur much more often
  -cursor only changes properly after going into full screen once
  -having more than 10 instance on the same page can cause issues (need to benchmark this)?

React best practices re-work (branch = sitenav_rework)
  -convert backend to an apollo server?
  -pages with audio need to know when player is open and adjust padding bottom
  -bridge links move after clicking buttons (as opposed to github link)
  -replace as many document.querySelector calls with refs
  -add onPress handler to ArrowButton to be able to hide the elements on bridge page when switching left/right 
  -add more complext logic in SkillPopup sort to weight created date?

JOB STUFF------------------------------------
  -Add section about contributing to enterprise-wide aggregation service (EGP) and SABER backend for Retail Employee Selling Tools
  -Portoflio repo is Private so make Public when the search starts
  -add to resume/portfolio "Identified multiple inefficiencies and proposed and implemented optimizations (backend interaction running through each action every time a new action is triggered even though the current state of the interaction was available; frontend added caching to various features reducing the number of calls needed)"
  -make york repos public (team and personal) and add a description to both with links (add tags too and make sure they are referenced in the resume section)
  -create a Solution Sidekick feature page (add to start page too; left side)
  -add challenges (make a 3js demo for horse jump code)
  -update downloadable resume
  -look into free options for other sites (dynamo are no longer free and don't work atm)
  -add resume end date 11/12 for contract work and 11/13 for FTE work?
  -add resume line talking point "10X increase in user base since starting" for Best Buy contract
  -minify SSK videos
  -add sort options of skill examples?
  -each instance of <Carousel/> has a section above it that can be refactored into <Carousel/>
  -make the carousel handle the calculation in setCarouselGridMaxColumnWidth() for $carousel-grid-width (instead of having to hard code in css variables)

BUGS------------------------------------
  -mobile - scrolling on own phone glitchy up and down fast
  -bridge demo page lacks carousel arrows
  -adjust PageNav such that the scroll percent is 100 for previous item when it is in the middle of the screen
  -mobile start screen doesn't show all of bottom and not scrollable
  -after playing a song then stopping and closing the player, the orange tab still appears
  -bridge video cards don't close when another one is opened
  -fix carousel issue (use 3rd party lib?)
  -bug with PageNav and no mouse where the scroll scaling doesn't apply to the last clicked item as it has :hover (is there a way to trigger a touch/click event in JS? so as to clear the :hover state) (remove hover effect on card when mobile input after close?)
  -PlayControl and RestartControl handleVideoProgress listeners can be run at the same time (doesn't seem to affect performance though)
  -when visiting all three video pages then waiting ~15 mins  with dev servers running, causes chrome to crash (but a single firefox tab?)
    -running no dev server, single tab mozilla, 20mins = no crash
  -changing viewport on home shows scroll text after it has faded out
  -changing viewport on home doesn't change text height spacing durin scroll
  -can't have multiple carousels on page due to same css var name


IDEAS-----------------------------------------------------------
  -add hover popup for references that pops up a card with image, quote (recommendation from ziprecruiter, and letter of recommendation from scott?), more detailed info about relationship with reference;  add personal references?


OPTIMIZATIONS:
  -memoize Card functions?
  -Go through every component and check for cases where I could use useCallback or useMemo?"




-figure out how to create a bash script to get all of the .js files in a dir and its sub-dirs and then create .ts files in the same location with the contents of the respective .js file

-need to do responsive images everywhere
-finish csharp and autobid.txt

-add a popdown menu when hovering over a Pagenav item that has multiple subsections, showing each subsection as a clickable link?
-work on the little matter of how onwards (doesn't flow well)

-consider a different bridge animation like fade in

-maybe alternate the rotation speed of cube based on user mouse interactions?


-how hard would it be to add a better animation to examples opening up in SiteNav?

-double check that no event listeners don't get cleaned up on page change


-need responsive styling for video carouselitems 
-work on OverlayText styling for CarouselItem
-add svgs to csharp layouts
-add notes to playlist syncer page?  what else to say about it?
-finish content in about

-change how the left,right,and bottom divs come in (stagger them timewise for a more interesting fx)




NOT SURE------------------------------------------------------------
  'I'm excited that you're here.'
  'This is the perfect opportunity'
  'to highlight some of my work'

  'I enjoy a difficult challange'
  'as well as 
  'but most of all meeting new people'

  'Feel free to parouse the site'
  'and make an evaluation for yourself'


-ideas for suggestions on home page 
  "get to know me on a personal level" <-- link to about page
  "Dive into the making of a trick-based card game"

  -create an html link that has a span as innerhtml that removes the ancor tag's styling , effectivelyrending it regular text surrounding by text that uses the same link.

mobile issues---------------------
  -examples link not expanded in navbar

-change scroll sensitivity (have it scroll futher down each scroll)
-finish about content
-finish about section story

Purpose of about--------------------------------------------
Bringing across the information that will make potential clients and employers stick around to find out more about you, in the hope of working with you, is crucial.

That being said, it's considered good practice to include an "About" section on your site. In this section, give a well-revised version of the most important (relevant) information about yourself, your experience, and maybe your approach as well.

Of course, there can be variation, but the most important thing is to try to identify your unique selling points and validators (past work and/or skills) and point them out as clearly as possible.
